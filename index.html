								<blockquote>I’ve been training with Latoya for about a year now. I saw growth and improvement in just a few weeks and her encouragement is always positive. 
									It’s her personality and auspicious attitude that keeps me coming back every time. Her kindness and caring towards others follows her wherever she goes.
									 Latoya is a hard working woman who is an excellent role model for anyone. There isn’t anything she cannot do! <br> - Carlee C</blockquote>
									 <blockquote>Latoya offers a down to earth approach to reiki healing. During each session, the cards she pulls for me are extremely accurate and offer an insightful take on issues I have struggled with or places I have excelled. I am always on the quest to better myself and my spiritual practice. These cards offer a very in depth and engaging perspective. Since it is a crystal deck, being able to have the crystals hands on as well as essential oil therapy is such a blissful experience. Her reiki healing is always a very intense but bright experience, and I always leaving feel like weight has fallen off my shoulders. 
										<br> - Allison O</blockquote>
										<blockquote>10/10 stars! 
											I started seeing Latoya twice weekly a few weeks ago. I wanted to learn some meditation, and yoga to improve my health, and anxiety struggles. 
											In just a few sessions I learned some breath exercises and easy meditations. 
											Latoya is patient, kind, soft spoken, and knowledgeable about overall mental/physical health. 
											<br> - Michael H</blockquote>
											<blockquote>10/10 stars! 
												Latoya was excellent in helping manage my PCOS. I struggled losing weight for years but the insight and knowledge she gave me was worth the investment! We worked with weight lifting and strengthening. She showed me tools to better understand my body dysmorphia and wrangle in my bad eating habits. After a year of training with her I was able to conceive after being told I would struggle and it wouldn’t be possible!!

												<br> - Sarah M</blockquote>
												<blockquote>Latoya has assisted in my healing through yoga, reiki, inner child work, and spiritual guidance. She has helped me through some very dark times. Her knowledge, personality and caring heart make Latoya and amazing modern medicine woman to work with.
													<br> - Jessica W</blockquote>
													<blockquote>Latoya is a gifted and powerful energy worker. I have been a regular client with her for several years in reiki, oracle card readings, shadow work, essential oils, and crystal healing modalities. I highly recommend Latoya to anyone seeking inner healing in an intimate and personalized setting. I feel strongly that she encompasses great experience, knowledge and expertise in the field of energy work, yoga, and wellness.
